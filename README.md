# My-Projects

A depository for past programs I coded or contributed to during college; small individual projects organized by folder, covering different languages and frameworks.

## 📁 Project Structure & Overview

Below are the main projects / folders in this repository, with a brief description:

| Folder / Project                                 | Description / Purpose                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AI_Tensorflow**                                | Machine-learning / AI experiments using TensorFlow (e.g. neural networks, data modeling)                                             |
| **Bitwise_Operations**                           | Small scripts / exercises focusing on bitwise operations for algorithm practice or learning low-level logic                          |
| **Register and Log in Dataset - Front End, Php** | Web project / backend + front-end using PHP to implement registration and login functionality, possibly for a dataset or user system |
| **RestaurantWebsite-Php**                        | A PHP-based website project to practice web development                                                                              |
| **WeatherApp-JS**                                | A JavaScript front-end project: likely a weather application that fetches API data and displays weather info in the browser          |

## 🧰 Languages & Technologies Used

Across the various projects, the repository includes code in:

- Python (for ML / data tasks)
- PHP (for backend / web apps)
- JavaScript (for front-end / web apps)
- HTML / CSS (for website front-end)
- Jupyter Notebook (for data / ML experiments)

## 🚀 Purpose & Why This Repo

The main goal of this repository is to keep a record of different exercises, demos, and projects I’ve worked on — from small scripts to full web apps — so I can revisit them, build on them, or showcase them as examples of my work and learning path.
